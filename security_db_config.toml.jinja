# To add repos, add a new [[repos]] entry with the org and repo keys specified.
# Optional keys are
# branches: An array of strings, each one corresponding to a branch name to query.
#           Defaults to ["main", "master', "develop"]
# test_workflows: a specifier for how to find which Github Actions correspond to tests.:
#                 Omitted - Use the default regex that looks for "test" or "tests" surrounded by
#                           whitespace, underscores, or hyphens and optionally preceded by a slash
#                           or followed by a period in the action workflow path.
#                           Finds the first action that matches the regex and uses the result for
#                           the test status.
#                 String - As above, but the string contains the regex.
#                 Array[String] - Looks for exact matches on the workflow path to the given
#                                 strings.
#                                 Once it finds a match for a particular string, it stops looking
#                                 for more  matches.
